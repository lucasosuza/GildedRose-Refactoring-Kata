# GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata
Solution the Refactoring Kata

This is a simple solution for the Kata. The code was produced following steps:

1. Coding tests to assure the basic behavior of the original implementation;
2. Removing the duplicity of code
3. Refactoring to improve the readability
4. Coding a small test for the new functionality
5. Implementing a solution for the test

## Building

The source code can be compiled using the command:

``` mvn clean package```

## Running

This code doesnÂ´t produces any default executable. 

To verify the expected behavior it has to be executed a "fixture" on text package TexttestFixture or running all tests.
